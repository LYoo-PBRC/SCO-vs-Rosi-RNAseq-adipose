# SCO-vs-Rosi-RNAseq-adipose

**Bulk RNA-seq pipeline for:**
> *An Artemisia scoparia extract and rosiglitazone have distinct but overlapping effects on adipocyte function*

---

## Overview

This repository contains R code, raw count data, and output folders for a pipeline comparing Artemisia scoparia (SCO) and rosiglitazone (ROSI) in murine adipocytes.

All main results are generated by a single R script (`main_analysis.R`).  
Significant DEGs, Venn slices, reversal genes, and pathway enrichment plots/tables are produced.  
All outputs are saved to the `output/` folder automatically.

## Requirements

- R version ≥ 4.1 recommended  
- **Packages:**  
  `edgeR`, `limma`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `openxlsx`, `reshape2`, `readr`, `ggrepel`, `enrichR`, `readxl`

Install everything at once:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2","dplyr","openxlsx","reshape2","readr","ggrepel","enrichR","readxl"))
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("edgeR", "limma"))
```

## Output

**After running, your output/ folder will contain:**

- `QC_plots/` – Density plot, PCA plot (for data QC)
- `limma_DE_results/` – Significant DEG tables for each comparison (adj.P.Val < 0.05)
- `limma_Venn/` – CSVs for all 2-way and 3-way DEG overlaps
- `limma_Reversal/` – 
    - Detailed reversal gene tables (CSV/XLSX)
    - All pathway barplots (WikiPathways Enrichr, including “pretty” plots)
    - Stacked barplots for directionality, etc.
- `fgsea/` – All fgsea barplots and tables (WikiPathways only)

**Only the significant genes (adj.P.Val < 0.05) are saved as DEG CSVs.**  
No “all genes” tables are saved.
