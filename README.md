# SCO-vs-Rosi-RNAseq-adipose

**Bulk RNA-seq pipeline for:**
> *An Artemisia scoparia extract and rosiglitazone have distinct but overlapping effects on adipocyte function*

---

## Overview

This repository contains R code, raw count data, and output folders for a pipeline comparing Artemisia scoparia (SCO) and rosiglitazone (ROSI) in murine adipocytes.

All main results are generated by a single R script (`main_analysis.R`).  
Significant DEGs, Venn slices, reversal genes, and pathway enrichment tables are produced.  
All outputs are saved to the `output/` folder automatically.
